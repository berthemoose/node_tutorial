This is a set of my Node.JS notes that I took why learning this environment. I had some fundamental JS and alogrythmics knowledge before beginning. 
These notes are based on several tutorials that I watched. They will all be listed below as attributions. 
This is by no means a professional's POV on learning anything, just my own documentation of the progress I make. 
Writing these notes helped me learn, and if reading them helps you, go ahead and use them. 

Remember to never rely on anything else that docs for absolute truth. Node's are here: https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/
