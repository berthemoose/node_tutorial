These are some Node.JS notes that I took why learning this environment. I had some fundamental computer science knowledge before beginning, and I also had used JS for a couple of months prior to that.

These notes are based on Node's official documentation, and several tutorials that I watched. They will all be listed below as attributions. 
This is by no means a professional's POV on learning anything, just my personal documentation of the progress I made. 
Writing these notes helped me learn, and if reading them helps you, go ahead and use them.
