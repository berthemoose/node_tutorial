            NODE JS EXTENSIVE TUTORIAL
            Node.JS is a JavaScript runtime environment compatible with Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS and other operating systems.
            
            Contrary to what JavaScript was until its creation (2010), Node.JS runs within the user's computer, and not strictly in the browser. 
            It allows for JS to be used as a full capacity server programming language, and helped it become the most popular programming language on the planet.

            Thanks to its well developed functionality in all modern browsers, combined with the server compatibility added by Node, JavaScript remains the one and only truly 'full-stack' programming language. It can be used to build applications in systems like the MERN stack that are based on Node, Express.js, React and MongoDB, or other web dev stacks based on JS.
